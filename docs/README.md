# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation and guides:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — high-level architecture overview
- `ONBOARDING.md` — steps to get a dev environment running
- `RUNBOOKS.md` — runbooks and troubleshooting
- `notion/` — CSV and README for importing tasks into Notion

Add more pages as the project grows (security, release notes, API docs).
